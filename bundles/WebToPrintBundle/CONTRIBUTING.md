# Contributing to Web To Print Bundle of Pimcore

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests
The Pimcore team heavily uses (and loves!) GitHub for all of our software management.
We use GitHub issues exclusively to track all bugs and features.

* [Open an issue](https://github.com/pimcore/web-to-print-bundle/issues) here on GitHub.
  If you can, **please provide a fix and create a pull request (PR) instead**; this will automatically create an issue for you.
* Report security issues only to security-issue@pimcore.com
* Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately - remember, Pimcore is open source and free of charge.
* Occasionally we'll close issues if they appear stale or are too vague - please don't take this personally!
  Please feel free to re-open issues we've closed if there's something we've missed and they still need to be addressed.
