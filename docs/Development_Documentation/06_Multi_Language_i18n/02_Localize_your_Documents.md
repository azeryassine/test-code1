# Localize your Documents

Pimcore allows you to localize every document. You can find the setting in your document in the tab `Properties`. 
There you can choose from language which is configured in the system settings.

The selected language is registered as a property on the document, which is inherited to all of it's children. 

If you have selected a language this will be automatically registered globally the ZF way 
(`\Zend_Registry::set("Zend_Locale", new \Zend_Locale($this->document->getProperty("language")))`). 

Because of this, every Pimcore and ZF module automatically recognized the locale, for example `\Zend_Date`, 
`\Pimcore\Translate` ( based on `\Zend_Translate`) as described later in this text.

It's no longer required to set the locale manually for example in your `\Website\Controller\Action::init();`. 

Since the language is a simple property you can access it like every other property like:
 
 ```php
 // in your controller / action
 $language = $this->document->getProperty("language");
  
  
 // in your view
 $language = $this->document->getProperty("language");
  
  
 // any document
 $doc = \Pimcore\Model\Document::getById(234);
 $language = $doc->getProperty("language");
  
  
 // accessing anywhere in your code using the registry (the common ZF way)
 $language = \Zend_Registry::get("Zend_Locale");
 ```
 
Once you have defined the language of your documents you can also use the [translate helper](./04_Shared_Translations) 
in your views, as described [here](./04_Shared_Translations). 


## Best practise for multi language websites
Every document has one single language/locale assigned. As a consequence of that, Pimcores best practise in terms of 
building multi language websites is to build a document subtree per language. 

![Localization Language Trees](../img/localization-documents1.png)

This has several advantages:
* Localized document keys, URLs and navigation structures
* Clean structure about where to find which content
* Transparent permission management based on the document tree
* etc. 

Pimcore provides two additional features to support editors in translating and managing documents for several languages: 

### Localization Tool

The localization tool for Pimcore documents is a comfort tool which supports creation and management of the same document
 for multiple languages. It can be accessed in the editor button row of every document. 

![Localization Tool](../img/localization-documents2.png)

Following features are supported: 
* **Creating new documents** for another language - either an empty document or and document using content inheritance (see below)
* **Link existing documents** in order to have the language link between documents
* **Unlink existing documents** in order to remove the language link between documents
* **Open Translation** to quickly navigate to the corresponing document in another language. 

 ```php
 $service = new \Pimcore\Model\Document\Service();
 $translations = $service->getTranslations($document); // return an array of all linked languages with associated document ID: Array ( [en] => 2 [fr] => 7 )
 ```
  
 // in your view
 $language = $this->document->getProperty("language");
  
  
 // any document
 $doc = \Pimcore\Model\Document::getById(234);
 $language = $doc->getProperty("language");
  
  
 // accessing anywhere in your code using the registry (the common ZF way)
 $language = \Zend_Registry::get("Zend_Locale");
 ```

### Content Inheritance
Content inheritance is a Pimcore feature to save duplicate data maintenance within documents. This feature is quite handy
in multi language document structures in order to maintain language independent content only once. 

For details see [Document Inheritance / Content Master Document](../03_Documents/11_Inheritance.md).


## Translating terms on the website
Pimcore comes with a translation module for the website which is explained in [Shared Translations](./04_Shared_Translations.md). 
This is what needs to be done to use translations in templates and display them accordingly on the website (frontend). 
E.g. button names, labels - all the stuff that is predefined by the template and not entered by the editor.
