# Creating CMS pages with Pimcore Documents

In the first part you'll learn the basics for creating CMS pages with Pimcore Documents. 

## Create template, layout and controller

### New Controller
First of all, we need our own controller. 
Let's call it ContentController.php. 
You have to push the file into ```website/controllers``` directory.

```php
<?php
use Website\Controller\Action;
use Pimcore\Model\Asset;

/**
 * Class ContentController
 */
class ContentController extends Action
{

    public function defaultAction()
    {
        $this->enableLayout();
    }
}
```

There is the only one action *defaultAction*.
The method *enableLayout* registers a ```\Zend_Layout``` to decorate our content page. 
In the defaultAction, we can put some custom code or assign values to the template.

### Create Template
Now we can create the templates for our new content page:
* Create a new folder in ```/website/view/scripts``` and name it like the controller (in this case *content*). 
* Put a new PHP file into this folder and name it like our action (*default.php*).

Then we can put some template code into it, for example:

```php
<?php /** @var $this \Pimcore\View */ ?>

<?php $this->layout()->setLayout('default'); ?>

    <h1><?= $this->input("headline", ["width" => 540]); ?></h1>

<?php while ($this->block("contentblock")->loop()) { ?>
    <h2><?= $this->input("subline"); ?></h2>
    <?= $this->wysiwyg("content"); ?>
<?php } ?>
```

Pimcore uses ```\Zend_View``` as templates and therefore plain php as template language. So you have the full power of
  ```\Zend_View``` with all Zend functionality available. In addition to that, there are some Pimcore additions like editables,
  which add editable parts to the layout. 
  For details concerning editables (like ```$this->input```, ```$this->block```, ...) see [Editables](../03_Documents/01_Editables/_index.md). 

### Add Layout
Pimcore uses the advantages of Zend_Layout out of the ZF, for details please read more here about it.
Because we have enabled the layout engine in our controller, we can use layouts to wrap our content page with another template which contains the main navigation, a sidebar, â€¦
With this code:

```php
<?php $this->layout()->setLayout('default'); ?>
```
We tell the engine that we want to use the layout default. Now create a new php file in the folder ```/website/views/layouts``` and name it to default.php (just like the name of the layout appending .php).
Then we can also put some HTML and template code into it:

```php
<?php /** @var $this \Pimcore\View */ ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <title>Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/website/static/css/screen.css" />
</head>
<body>
    <div id="site">
        <div id="logo">
            <a href="http://www.pimcore.org/"><img src="/pimcore/static6/img/logo-gray.svg" style="width: 200px;" /></a>
            <hr />
            <div class="claim">
                THE OPEN-SOURCE ENTERPRISE PLATFORM FOR PIM, CMS, DAM & COMMERCE
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="info">
            <?php echo $this->layout()->content; ?>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

The code ```<?= $this->layout()->content ?>``` is the placeholder where your contentpage will be inserted.

### Putting it together with Pimcore documents
Now we need to connect the action to a page. This will be done in the Pimcore backend.
First, click on the left under "Documents" at "home".

![Create page](../img/Pimcore_Elements_check_homepage.png)

Now select the tab "settings" in the newly opened window.
In controller and action input you have to select the name of the controller and the name of the action.  
If everything goes properly, you see the view like below:

![Page settings](../img/Pimcore_Elements_homepage_settings.png)

You can test the new controller and action, after save.
Just change tab to *edit*. Now, you see your page with an editable place.

![Page edit preview](../img/Pimcore_Elements_homepage_edit_tab.png)


# Introduction to Assets

In assets, all binary files like images, video, pdfs, ... can uploaded, stored and managed. 
You can organize them in a directory structure and assign them additional meta data. 
Once uploaded, an asset can be used in multiple places - e.g. documents or objects. 

In terms of images or videos, always upload only one master version. Thumbnails for different output channels can be
created directly by Pimcore (Master Data Management). 

For this tutorial, at least add one file which later you will use in an object. 

There are many ways to upload files:
* Just drag it from files browser on your computer
* Right click on the home and choose the most interesting method.

![Upload assets](../img/asset-upload.png)



# Introduction to objects
We've already made our own controller, template and view and we're allowed to adding text from admin panel to our pages.
In this chapter we will create a simple product database and connect this to our CMS page.  

## Create the class

Ok, let's create our first class for objects. 
<div class="inline-imgs">

[comment]: #TODOinlineimgs

Go to: ![Settings](../img/Pimcore_Elements_settings.png) **Settings -> Object -> Classes** and click the button with *Add class* label.

</div>

![Add product class](../img/Pimcore_Elements_class_add.png)

Now, there is a new product class. 
Classes are like database scheme for the objects. 

More specific knowledge you can find in [Objects section](../05_Objects/_index.md)

The product should have: SKU, picture, name and description. 

* Go to the edit page of the class product 
* Click on the right after **Base -> Add layout Component -> Panel** - the main panel for elements of the class created, now we can add main products elements.
* To add elements:
    * Click on the right after **Panel** and then **Add data component -> Text -> Input**, after it change the name of the input to **sku**
    * In the same way, add new component for **product name** and change the name of the input to **name**
    * Now we're going to add WYSIWYG attribute. We use it to create a description for products. **Add data component -> Text -> WYSIWYG**. Let's call it **description**.
    * The last attribute is the picture. We can use special data component from **Other** section called **Image**. Name the attribute **picture**.

If everything goes well, the new class looks like in the picture:

![Product class](../img/Pimcore_Elements_product_class.png)

**Important:** Every generated class in Pimcore admin panel has also mapper in the code. You can find the product class in ```website/var/classes/Object/Product.php``` 

## Add new object

Ok, we've just prepared the simple class for new products. 
Now we can use it to create objects. 

* Open the objects section on the left and click on the right button after **Home** (Note that you can create also directories structure for objects).
* Choose **Add object -> product** and fill the input with some name, for example: **tshirt**
* Add values for sku, name and description attributes.
* Click  *Save & Publish*

Probably, your view looks like below:

![New product](../img/Pimcore_Elements_new_product.png)

The last step to finish the product object is add a photo.

[comment]: #TODOinlineimgs

<div class="inline-imgs">

The one way to upload a photo is this button: ![Upload image to an object](../img/Pimcore_Elements_upload_button.png) or just drag file which you uploaded from Assets section.

</div>

Click **Save & Publish** button. 

That's it. 

![Complete object](../img/Pimcore_Elements_complete_object.png)


# Putting the pieces togehter
Let's put the pieces together and connect the products to the CMS. 

## Update controller and template
Therefore create another action in the controller (ContentController) called ```productAction```.
 
```php
<?php
use Website\Controller\Action;
use Pimcore\Model\Asset;

/**
 * Class ContentController
 */
class ContentController extends Action
{
    public function defaultAction ()
    {
        $this->enableLayout();
    }
    
    public function productAction()
    {
        $this->enableLayout();
    }
    
}
```

Then we also need the new template ```website/views/scripts/content/product.php``` 

```php
<?php /** @var $this \Pimcore\View */ ?>
<?php $this->layout()->setLayout('default'); ?>



<h1><?= $this->input("headline", ["width" => 540]); ?></h1>

<div class="product-info">
    <?php if($this->editmode):
        echo $this->href('product');
    else: ?>

<!--            Product information-->

    <?php endif; ?>
</div>

```

New lines:

```php
$this->editmode
```

The parameter above check if view is called from the Pimcore backend and therefore you might have some different output. 

```php
$this->href('product');
```

Href is one of editable elements. It would be used to make relation 1 to 1.
The full list of editables is presented in the special section: [Editables](../03_Documents/01_Editables/_index.md)


## Add the product object to a document

The last thing is to show the product in the body of the document you created. 

Let's go back to the documents section. Right click on the Home then **Add Page -> Empty Page**.
In the settings label, choose the product action and the content controller, click save and go back to the edit tab.

There is new element (**Href**) which you added in the product template.
Drag the product object to that input and click **Save & Publish**.

![Drag the object to the document](../img/Pimcore_Elements_drag_to_document.png)

Let's see what happened on the front... 

Go to the product page. In my case, it would be *http://pimcore.local/tshirt* where *tshirt* is the identifier of the product (the name visible the documents tree).

We haven't implemented frontend feature yet. Therefore, the page doesn't contain product information.

In the template file (```website/views/scripts/content/product.php```) add few lines:

```php
<?php /** @var $this \Pimcore\View */ ?>
<?php $this->layout()->setLayout('default'); ?>



<h1><?= $this->input("headline", ["width" => 540]); ?></h1>

<div class="product-info">
    <?php if($this->editmode):
        echo $this->href('product');
    else: ?>

    <div id="product">
        <?php
        /** @var \Pimcore\Model\Object\Product $product */
        $product = $this->href('product')->getElement();
        ?>
        <h2><?php echo $this->escape($product->getName()); ?></h2>
        <div class="content">
            <?php echo $product->getDescription(); ?>
        </div>
    </div>

    <?php endif; ?>
</div>

```

You are able to access to your object by method **getElement**.
Now you have access to whole data from the object (name, description, ...).
It's a good practice to add ```@var``` doc in every view. If you do this you have access to auto complete in your IDE.


## Add a thumbnail configuration
To show the product image in the view, we need to add a thumbnail configuration first. With thumbnail configurations
pimcore automatically calculates optimized images for certain output channels. For details on thumbnails, see TODO. 

For adding a thumbnail configuration see the following screen. Just add a configuration named ```content```. 
![Adding thumbnail configuration](../img/adding_thumbnails.png)


## Showing the image in the view
And the last step, we would like to show the product picture.

```php
<div class="content">
    <?php
    $picture = $product->getPicture();
    if($picture instanceof \Pimcore\Model\Asset\Image):
        /** @var \Pimcore\Model\Asset\Image $picture */
        
    ?>
        <?= $picture->getThumbnail("content")->getHTML(); ?>
        
    <?php endif; ?>
    <?php echo $product->getDescription(); ?>
</div>
```
As you see, image attribute is an additional class with useful parameter.
To print out the image in the right size just use the method ```getThumbnail``` which returns the ```<img>``` tag with the 
correct image path and also sets alt attributes to values based on the asset meta data. 

Now the product page looks like that:
